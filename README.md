# bammmmmmmmm.JSP_MVC_Basic_001 is a simple JSP MVC example, in a Dynamic Web Project

This is an MVC pattern, taking login details in a View JSP (Login), and, via a Controller Servlet, checks an ArrayList of a 'User' object
(Model) for a match (within a 'ValidUser' Business Service) and returning the appropriate one to another View JSP (Wecome), if applicable.
If the ArrayList doesn't contain the object the Login View is returned again.
